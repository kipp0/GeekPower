##NOTE
Since no libraries and frameworks are aloud, i've decided against the use npm and webpack simply because it would only allow for basic comforts like es6 and sass ect..

##Adds

1. Added 3 links for each task set by you for easier navigation.
2. animations for the navigation bar were set using 2 methods.
	a. First one with pure javascript
  b. second by setting a class and adding it to element via onclick() method
3. Created basic UI for AJAX calls.

Thank you for considering me.
