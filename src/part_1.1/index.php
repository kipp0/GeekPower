            Welcome to My Submission.<br><br> I would like to first thank you for selecting me to be amoungst the candidates for your Web Developer position.

            As you have probably already noticed there are three additional links added to this projects navigation bar simply for making it easier to navigate between each assignment.
            I would also like to mention that I have purposefully decided to build each animation diffrently.<br><br> For reveiling and hidding the navigation bar on the side I have
            used the built in JS setInterval() and clearInterval(), and for reveiling and hidding the accordion I used CSS and a little bit of javascript for adding and removing the classes.
          </p>
          <br>

            As far as my decision goes for building the layout. I went with flexbox and the traditional absolute positioning for a more speedy development.
            I am fully aware of CSS' new grid layout option but I didn't think it to be necessary for such a simple UI.
