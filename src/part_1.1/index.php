            Welcome to My Submission.<br><br> I would like to first thank you for selecting me to be amoungst the candidates for your Web Developer position.

            There are three additional links added to this projects navigation bar in order to make it easier to navigate between each assignment.
            I have decided to build each animation differently to demonstrate multiple solutions.<br><br> To reveal and hide the navigation bar on the right side,
            I used the built-in setInterval() and clearInterval() functions.
            Furthermore, for the accordion, I used CSS and javascript for adding and removing classes.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            I used Flexbox and traditional absolute positioning due to the simplicity of this assignments layout.
